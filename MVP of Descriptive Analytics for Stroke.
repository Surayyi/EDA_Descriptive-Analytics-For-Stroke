#### This HeatMap showing the correlation between each columns , as you can see age is the most common factor with stroke, but we are looking for diseases such as obesity , heart diseases or diabetes, so the age is not diseases.

### Initial conclusion,  a stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of brain is interrupted or reduced. After doing some analysis the Body Mass Index or hypertension might be the most common diseases associated with stroke. We will see the result in full project.
